As a recent graduate with an Associates of Science in Computer Science I felt as if my actual programming skills were a little underdeveloped. 
I decided with the help of AI to develop a Python learning plan. With that plan, I have begun building a simple conatct manager. 

The manager started with just a simple list, before being saved to a CSV for permanence. Now currently working on upgrading from CSV to SQLite DB.
